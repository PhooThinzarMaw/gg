Thihathura Tin Aung Myint Oo was one of the Vice Presidents of Myanmar. He is also chairman of Burmese Trade Council, having been appointed in November 2007 by Than Shwe, in response to Saffron Revolution demonstrations in October of that year, and Minister of Military Affairs. He resigned his Vice President post in May 2012. He joined the Buddhist monkhood on 3 May, after speculation over his disappearance had circulated throughout new media.

He graduated from the 12th intake of the Defence Services Academy and subsequently earned the title "Thihathura" in 1980 for fighting the Communist Party of Burma.[5] He was nominated into the State Peace and Development Council in 2007 as Secretary (1), replacing Thein Sein, and was promoted to general in March 2009.
